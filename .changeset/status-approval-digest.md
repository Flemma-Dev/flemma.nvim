Added an Approval section to `:Flemma status` showing auto-approve, deny, and require-approval classification per tool with preset expansion. Frontmatter overrides are marked with ✲ on individual items across Tools, Approval, Parameters, and Autopilot sections, with a conditional legend at the bottom.
