Update the following file (and only this file!): @lua/flemma/models.lua - with up-to-date information about the models and pricing of Google Gemini (via Vertex AI), Anthropic Claude, and OpenAI.

To complete this task, you will need to read and parse the following web pages:

- For Google Gemini (via Vertex AI):
  - https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/model-versions
  - https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/provisioned-throughput/supported-models
  - https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/pricing

- For Anthropic Claude:
  - https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview
  - https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/pricing

- For OpenAI:
  - https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing?latest-pricing=standard
  - https://platform.openai.com/docs/deprecations
  - https://platform.openai.com/docs/models - this page requires you to scan the "Frontier models" section then recursively follow links to get the full list of OpenAI models and aliases.

Today's date is {{date}}. You will need this when assessing model's retirement dates and deprecation notices.

When parsing these pages, pay attention to model names as well as model aliases (usually include version numbers or dates).
If any model names imply non-text capabilities (e.g., "vision", "image", "video", "audio", etc.), ignore those models and do not include them in the local file.

IMPORTANT! If any of the pages return a 404 or content that doesn't match what can be inferred from the URL, or you find that they are behind a login wall or require JavaScript - report that you cannot complete the task. This is specifically an issue with OpenAI's pages which often require completing a challenge. BUT THERE IS A WAY TO WORK AROUND THIS - ask the user to provide you with the Markdown source of the failing page(s) and you can proceed from there.

Think hard to avoid making mistakes as you parse the web pages and update the models file.

If a model is present in the local file, but retired or past it's deprecation date, drop it from the local file.
If a new model is present on the web pages, but obviously not in the local file, add it to the local file with all relevant information.

Should you discover that during the update of Anthropic Claude models there is a new Sonnet version, this will require extra attention in other places of the codebase. If, and only if, there is a newer Sonnet version, scan the codebase for references of the previous Sonnet version and update them accordingly. To this using a search pattern that captures all possible variations, casing and punctuation of Sonnet, e.g., instead of searching for punctuation, prefer using a wildcard. Example: "Sonnet 4.0" can be searched as /sonnet.?4(.?0)?/i

You will work in a step-by-step manner, first parsing the web pages and extracting the relevant information (or pausing and asking for user's support), then updating the file.
When finished, run `make test` to check for tests that MAY reference retired or deprecated models.
