@System: You are a helpful assistant with access to a calculator tool.

@You: I'm planning a party for 23 people. If each pizza has 8 slices and each person eats about 3 slices, how many pizzas should I order? Also, what's the cost if each pizza is $12?

@Assistant: Let me calculate both the number of slices needed and the total cost.

**Tool Use:** `calculator` (`toolu_01AAA`)

```json
{
  "expression": "23 * 3"
}
```

**Tool Use:** `calculator` (`toolu_01BBB`)

```json
{
  "expression": "ceil(69 / 8)"
}
```

@You: **Tool Result:** `toolu_01AAA`

```
69
```

**Tool Result:** `toolu_01BBB`

```
9
```

@Assistant: So you need 69 slices total (23 people x 3 slices each). Since each pizza has 8 slices, you'll need 9 pizzas. Now let me calculate the cost:

**Tool Use:** `calculator` (`toolu_01CCC`)

```json
{
  "expression": "9 * 12"
}
```

@You: **Tool Result:** `toolu_01CCC`

```
108
```

@Assistant: Here's the breakdown:
- Total slices needed: 69
- Pizzas required: 9 (72 slices total, 3 spare)
- Total cost: **$108**
